      <h1>What is the Digital Acquisitions Pilot?</h1>
      <p>The federal government spends about $80 billion on information technology (IT) contracts but doesn’t receive $80 billion worth of value. The way the government uses and buys technology has changed, but the workforce, policies, and procedures have not fully caught up with the speed of technology. The digital acquisition pilot empowers a cross-functional team of digital and acquisition experts to shift from legacy to modern-day digital acquisition practices.<br/><br/>Officially announced by the White House Office of Federal Procurement Policy (OFPP) March 2016, this fully-funded project is a 5-8 month initiative lending a team of experts from the Presidential Innovation Fellows, 18F, and US Digital Service to federal agencies to train up a cadre of digital service experts. This pilot team will provide basic training to a cross-functional team sourced from each agency and lead two digital acquisitions--one led by 18F/USDS teams (shadowed by agencies) and a second that is self directed by the agency team.</p>
